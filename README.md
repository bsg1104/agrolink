this is a web app that connects farmers to buyers without middlemen




 Project Overview: AgroLink

AgroLink is a platform that empowers smallholder cocoa and coffee farmers by connecting them directly to buyers, lenders, and tools â€” eliminating middlemen, promoting fair trade, and offering access to credit, investment, and supply chain transparency.

- Build trust via transparency and reputation systems
- Enable mobile-first access for African farmers

 Core Features

 Trade Platform

- Buyers view listings, chat, and pay directly

 Microloans
- Diaspora investors or NGOs lend stablecoins to farmers
- On-chain or off-chain reputation/credit score system

 Language and Accessibility
- Interface in English, Twi, Ewe, etc.
- Option for voice input and playback (text-to-speech + speech-to-text)

 Offline Support
- Progressive Web App (PWA) caching features
- SMS or USSD fallback in later versions
